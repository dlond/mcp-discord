# MCP Discord Rust Implementation Proposal ðŸ¦€

## Living Document
*Last Updated: August 22, 2025*

This document outlines our vision for a Rust-based MCP Discord server, building on learnings from the Python implementation.

## Why Rust?

### Technical Benefits
- **Memory Safety**: No GC pauses, predictable performance
- **Async Excellence**: Tokio + async/await perfect for Discord's event-driven model
- **Single Binary**: Easy deployment, no Python environment needed
- **Type Safety**: Catch protocol mismatches at compile time
- **Performance**: Handle multiple Claude instances without breaking a sweat

### Ecosystem Advantages
- **Serenity/Twilight**: Mature Discord libraries with excellent async support
- **Serde**: Perfect for MCP's JSON-RPC protocol
- **Tokio**: Battle-tested async runtime
- **Tower**: Middleware stack for request handling

## Architecture Vision

### Core Components

```rust
// 1. MCP Protocol Layer
mod mcp {
    pub struct Server {
        discord: DiscordClient,
        sessions: HashMap<SessionId, Session>,
    }
    
    impl McpProtocol for Server {
        async fn handle_request(&mut self, req: Request) -> Response {
            // Route to Discord operations
        }
    }
}

// 2. Discord Integration Layer  
mod discord {
    pub struct DiscordClient {
        cache: Cache,
        http: HttpClient,
        gateway: Gateway,
    }
}

// 3. Tool Registry
mod tools {
    pub enum Tool {
        SendMessage { channel: ChannelId, content: String },
        ReadMessages { channel: ChannelId, limit: u32 },
        CreateThread { name: String, message: MessageId },
        SearchHistory { query: String, channel: Option<ChannelId> },
        // ... more tools
    }
}
```

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Stateful Connection**: Maintain Discord gateway connection for real-time events
2. **Caching Strategy**: Smart caching of messages/channels to reduce API calls  
3. **Rate Limit Handling**: Built-in backpressure and retry logic
4. **Structured Logging**: Tracing for debugging Claude-Discord interactions

## Feature Roadmap

### Phase 1: Feature Parity with Python âœ…
- [ ] Basic message operations (send, read, react)
- [ ] Channel discovery and listing
- [ ] Server information
- [ ] Role management
- [ ] Message moderation

### Phase 2: Enhanced Capabilities ðŸš€
- [ ] **Thread Management**: Create, archive, manage threads for organizing work
- [ ] **Rich Embeds**: Format PR/issue notifications beautifully
- [ ] **File Attachments**: Upload logs, reports, code snippets
- [ ] **Webhook Creation**: For external integrations
- [ ] **Presence Updates**: Show Claude's current task in Discord status

### Phase 3: Claude-Specific Features ðŸ¤–
- [ ] **Cross-Claude Awareness**: See other Claude instances' activities
- [ ] **Task Queuing**: Discord-based task distribution among Claudes
- [ ] **Smart Notifications**: Context-aware @mentions based on urgency
- [ ] **Session Persistence**: Resume conversations across Claude restarts
- [ ] **Audit Logging**: Track all Claude actions for review

### Phase 4: Advanced Integration ðŸŽ¯
- [ ] **GitHub Integration**: Auto-link PRs/issues with Discord threads
- [ ] **Metrics Dashboard**: Track Claude productivity via Discord
- [ ] **Voice Channel Summaries**: Transcribe and summarize voice meetings
- [ ] **Slash Commands**: Direct Claude control from Discord

## Implementation Strategy

### Development Approach
1. **Start Simple**: Basic MCP server that can connect to Discord
2. **Incremental Features**: Add tools one by one with tests
3. **Python Compatibility**: Ensure config format works with existing setup
4. **Parallel Development**: Run alongside Python version initially

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Mock Discord API responses
- **Integration Tests**: Test with real Discord test server
- **Load Testing**: Multiple Claude instances stress test
- **Compatibility Tests**: Ensure MCP protocol compliance

## Performance Goals

- **Latency**: < 100ms for message operations
- **Throughput**: Handle 1000+ messages/second
- **Memory**: < 50MB baseline memory usage
- **Startup**: < 1 second cold start
- **Concurrent Claudes**: Support 10+ simultaneous instances

## Security Considerations

- **Token Management**: Secure storage using OS keyring
- **Permission Scoping**: Minimal Discord permissions required
- **Audit Trail**: Log all operations with timestamps
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect Discord's rate limits gracefully
- **Error Handling**: Never expose tokens in error messages

## Migration Path

1. **Parallel Run**: Both Python and Rust versions simultaneously
2. **Feature Testing**: A/B test features between implementations
3. **Gradual Rollout**: Move Claudes one by one to Rust version
4. **Full Migration**: Deprecate Python once Rust is stable

## Open Source Strategy

### Repository Structure
```
mcp-discord-rust/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ mcp/          # MCP protocol implementation
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ discord/      # Discord client logic
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ tools/        # Tool definitions
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.rs       # Entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/            # Test suite
â”œâ”€â”€ benches/          # Performance benchmarks
â”œâ”€â”€ examples/         # Usage examples
â””â”€â”€ docs/             # Architecture docs
```

### Community Approach
- **MIT License**: Maximum flexibility for contributors
- **Clear Contributing Guide**: Make it easy to contribute
- **Issue Templates**: Bug reports, feature requests
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for testing and releases
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive rustdoc + examples

## Success Metrics

- **Adoption**: Used by multiple Claude instances daily
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime over 30 days
- **Performance**: Consistently faster than Python version
- **Community**: 10+ external contributors
- **Features**: All Phase 1-3 features implemented

## Questions to Explore

1. Should we use Serenity or Twilight for Discord?
2. How to handle Discord's gateway reconnection elegantly?
3. Best way to structure MCP tools in Rust?
4. Should we support plugins/extensions?
5. How to make debugging easy for Claude users?

## Next Steps

- [ ] Set up Rust project structure
- [ ] Implement minimal MCP server
- [ ] Add first Discord tool (send_message)
- [ ] Create test Discord server
- [ ] Document learnings from Python version

## Notes & Ideas

*Add random thoughts, discoveries, and ideas here as we go...*

- Consider using `clap` for CLI argument parsing
- Maybe support multiple Discord servers simultaneously?
- Could we make this work with Matrix/Slack too? (future)
- Performance dashboard using Prometheus metrics?
- WebAssembly version for browser-based Claudes? ðŸ¤¯
